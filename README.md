# CPU/GPU Memory & Near-Data Processing Homework

This repository contains assignments from a hardware systems class focusing on CPU/GPU memory architecture, cache design, DRAM simulation, GPU programming, and near-data processing (PIM). Each assignment applies industry-standard tools to analyze, simulate, and optimize real-world memory and processing behavior.

## üìÅ Assignments Overview

### HW1: Roofline Model Analysis
We analyzed memory and compute bottlenecks using the Roofline model via Intel Advisor. The assignment profiled 10 matrix/vector implementations to observe performance trends. Key deliverables included:
- Roofline plots comparing different kernels
- INTOPS/sec and arithmetic intensity tables
- System configuration summary and ridge point classification

**Tools:** Intel Advisor, C++, Roofline plots

### HW2: Cache Design with CACTI
This assignment explored the trade-offs between cache size, associativity, port count, and technology node using CACTI. We swept various parameters and reported:
- Access time, area, energy, and data efficiency trends
- Optimal configurations for L1 and LLC caches

**Tools:** CACTI, Linux shell

### HW3: DRAM Simulation with DRAMsim3
We simulated memory access patterns (random, streaming, mixed) across different DRAM types: DDR4, LPDDR4, GDDR6, and HBM2. The analysis included:
- Bandwidth, energy, and latency comparison
- Command-level activity (`ACT`, `PRE`) trends
- DRAM selection for power vs performance needs

**Tools:** DRAMsim3, Python, JSON-to-CSV conversion

---

### HW4: GPU Programming with CUDA
This assignment focused on completing CUDA kernels for matrix addition, multiplication, and reduction. We:
- Verified CPU vs GPU output correctness
- Benchmarked GPU kernels with and without shared memory
- Profiled kernel execution using `nvprof` and CUDA events

**Tools:** CUDA Toolkit, `nvcc`, `nvprof`, OpenMP
